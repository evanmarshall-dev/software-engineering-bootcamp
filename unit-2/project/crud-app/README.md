# UNIT 2 PROJECT - CRUD APP

## MVP

- The app utilizes EJS Templates for rendering views to users.
- The app uses session-based authentication.
- The app’s files are organized following the conventions taught in lectures.
- The app has at least one data entity in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
- The app has full CRUD functionality.
- Authorization is implemented in the app. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
- The app is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it.

## Code Conventions

- The app runs without errors in both the terminal and the browser console.
- The code in the app adheres to coding conventions covered in lessons, like using plural names for arrays.
- The app follows RESTful routing conventions for routes.
- The app does not contain dead code, commented-out sections, or console logs.
- The app is coded using proper indentation.

## UI/UX

- Your app exhibits a visual theme, like a consistent color palette and cohesive layout across pages.
- CSS Flexbox or Grid is utilized for page layout design.
- The site is easily navigable by a first-time user. For example, navigation should be done through links instead of having to type in a URL to navigate around the app.
- Colors used on the site have appropriate contrast, meeting WCAG 2.0 level AA standards.
- When editing an item, the form is pre-filled with that item’s details.
- Only the user who created data can see and interact with the UI for editing or deleting that data.
- All images on the site have alt text.
- No text is placed on top of an image in a way that makes the text inaccessible.
- All buttons are styled.

## Git/GitHub

- You are shown as the only contributor to the project on GitHub.
- The GitHub repository used for the project is named appropriately. For example, names like book-binder or wellness-tracker are appropriate names, whereas ga-project or men-stack-project are not. The repo must be publicly accessible. Be sure to create the repo on your personal GitHub account and ensure that it is public.
- Your repo should have commits that date back to the very beginning of the project. If you start over with a new repo, do not delete the old one.
- Commit messages should be descriptive of the work done in the commit.

## README Requirements

- Screenshot/Logo: A screenshot of your app or a logo.
- Your app’s name: Include a description of your app and its functionality. Background info about the app and why you built it is a nice touch.
- Getting started: Include a link to your deployed app and a link to your planning materials.
- Attributions: This section should include links to any external resources (such as libraries or assets) you used to develop your application that require attribution. You can exclude this section if it does not apply to your application.
- Technologies used: List of the technologies used, for example: JavaScript and any major frameworks or libraries.
- Next steps: Planned future enhancements (stretch goals).

## Presentation ideas

You will have a maximum of 5 minutes to present your project. While the structure and content of your presentation are ultimately up to you, here are some potential ideas and topics to cover:

- Discuss the app. Including details about why you chose the app is a nice touch.
- Use the app! Demo full-CRUD data operations.
- Briefly show off something unique in your code or a piece of code you’re particularly proud of.
- Share your experience with the project - what was challenging, what did you gain from building this project?

## Building your planning materials

Use Trello for your project planning work. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3F3l3psqXY) has some helpful tips to get started using Trello if you’ve never used it before. Check out this [Trello support article](https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/changing-the-visibility-of-a-board/) to make your planning materials publicly available.

### Details

You will submit a public Trello board with these project planning details:

- MVP user stories, written in the following template: As a [user role], I want [feature], so that [reason]. If the reason is obvious, it can be excluded.
- Wireframes for your app’s main pages. For example, if you were building a blogging app, you might have wireframes for a landing page, the posts index page, and the add post page.
- An ERD for your app’s data and the relationships between that data.

To organize this information, set up the Trello board for your project with the following lists:

- **MVP User Stories**: To hold your MVP user stories. Each user story should be an individual card in the list.
- **Wireframes**: To hold the wireframes for your app. Each wireframe should be an individual card on the list. You may also want to include Wireframes built with your stretch goals in mind. If you do this, ensure that these cards are clearly labeled.
- **ERD**: To hold the ERD for your project. You may want to include an ERD built with your stretch goals in mind as well. If you do this, ensure it is clearly labeled on a separate card.
