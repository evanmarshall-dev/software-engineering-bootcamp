# MEN Stack Error Handling

## Foundations

Error handling typically refers to the process of managing errors that occur during the execution of an application.

Effective error handling is essential for maintaining the stability, security, and usability of an application. It plays a crucial role in identifying and managing unexpected issues, making our applications more reliable.

- For **users**, it ensures a smoother experience by providing meaningful feedback when something goes wrong.
- For **developers**, it aids in debugging and maintaining the codebase by providing insights into the nature and location of errors.

### Types of Errors in Node.js

- **Runtime errors**: These occur during the execution of the program, such as trying to access a property of an undefined object and can crash the application if not handled properly.
- **Operational errors**: These are related to external factors, such as network issues, database connection failures, or file system errors. They are often recoverable and should be handled gracefully.
- **Promise rejections**: When using Promises (async tasks), unhandled rejections can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Custom errors**: Developers can create their own error types to represent specific error conditions in their applications.
