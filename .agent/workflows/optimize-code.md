Code Optimization Workflow

Goal: Review and optimize the open file. Instructions:

Analyze the time complexity (Big O) of the current functions.

Identify any nested loops that can be flattened or optimized.

Check for redundant variable assignments.

Output: Provide a refactored version of the code that improves performance, and explain why it is faster.
